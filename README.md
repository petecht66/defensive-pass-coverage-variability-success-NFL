This project was completed for SPAX402: Predictive Analysis with Athletics Data, a Sports Analytics (SPAX) course taught at the University of Delaware. The professor for this course, Professor Jack Davis, is currently the Associate Athletic Director of Business Intelligence, Analytics, and Strategy at the University of Delaware Athletic Department. A key objective of this course is to prepare students for a career in professional or collegiate athletics.

For my final project, I wanted to look at how variation in defensive pass coverage scheme usage (Cover 0, Cover 1, Cover 2, etc.) affected the performance of a team's pass defense. I have heard about several success stories from defenses that consistently mix up the defensive looks that they show to the opposing offense. I wanted to investigate the truth behind this idea, particularly in the context of pass defense and defensive pass coverage strategies.
